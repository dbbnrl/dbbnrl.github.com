So, I've finally decided to try out this blogging thing.

Recently I've been fiddling around on a project that (so far) involves simultaneously learning modern OpenGL and Haskell.  And Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).  Oh, and a bit of WXWindows, possibly.

All of which involves getting a lot of concepts straight in my head, which I'm thinking might be easiest if I take notes, some of which might actually be organized enough for other people to find useful, which suggests that I should look into blogging...

In my typical premature-optimization, tool-focused style, I created this blog on wordpress.com, discovered through further research that it wasn't *quite* perfect for my needs, and abandoned it the same day (after zero posts) to start getting octopress-over-github configured.  This way is much geekier, which makes it Better.

Oh, and I keep meaning to buy some parts and do a bit of Arduino-based robotics, though at this point I've spent so much time thinking about doing that without actually *doing* it (including hours of research and a carefully constructed shopping list) that Raspberry Pi may now be a better option.  I should really research that...

There's a pattern here, which I hope to break out of by:

 * Doing things in small increments and committing code to Git frequently, and
 * Blogging frequently about what I'm working on.

The former has helped my productivity at work quite a bit. (And helped curtail my tendency toward over-design and premature optimization).  The latter is just the application of the same principle to mental output that isn't code and doesn't go into revision control (though with Github pages, there's a certain additional symmetry...)

I'm not quite sure why I'm telling myself these things, it's not as if the Internet is listening.  I suppose my audience is really Future Dan.

Hello, Future Dan.
